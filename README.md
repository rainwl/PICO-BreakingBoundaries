# PICO-BreakingBoundaries
BreakingBoundaries:Two-dimensional characters to pursue three-dimensional objects, just like my youth, to pursue people who can never be caught

## Overview
write later
## Idea
There's some idea about this game.

### Draw Square Mesh

Drawing a square and there will be generated a mesh with 4 vertices and 2 faces,and give materials.

I can also add rigidbody component to make it can be threw by me.

And this, should be defined as a infinite operation.

we could use this capacity every where and every time.

And when we generate a mesh ,if we do not throw it,
the mesh will fade away later,such as 3 seconds.

For example , when we hold the handler,press the trigger
and move the handler,to move as a square,or create 4 points
using press trigger 4 times,
and then we generate a mesh based on path or these 4 points.

we also need to write a script to handle the action of this mesh,
such as fade away after 3 secs.

### Draw Cube Volume
when user put 7 points as a cube side view,i think this
is not good .

we need to define a action to draw,"draw",you know,draw.

press the trigger ,and draw the cube outline,and use some ways
to detect if there has been some outline and judge whether it 
meet my needs.

whether this cube has 4 faces(or 8 triangles),no up and down,
or 12 faces(12 triangles),you know what i say.

I need to define a data struct to describe these graph.
